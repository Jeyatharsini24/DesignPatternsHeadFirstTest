1. Need a program to draw circle and triangle:
typical approach: Shape(name, draw()) <- Circle and Rectangle

2. Color of blue and red:
Circle <- BlueCircle and RedCircle , Triangle <- Blue Triangle and Red Triangle ... wrong: 

Correct: Shape(color, name, draw()) Has a IShapeColor(myColor, getShapeColor()) <- ShapeColorBlueImpl and ShapeColorRedImpl

3. Green color and triangle:
Can add more in separate hierarchies
