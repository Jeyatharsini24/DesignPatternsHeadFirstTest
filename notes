Strategy : I don't like to have empty overriding methods just because I am going to introduce a new feature for some existing things
Eg: Flying feature for Duck

Observer : Observe on changes for one to many relationship
Eg: Overview, publisher-subscriber
Event Listeners in java

Decorator : kind of wrappers, add features dynamically
Eg: Coffee, Milk, Soy
Streams in Java

Factory : encapsulate object creation
Eg: Pizza with type

Factory method : allowing sub classes to decide object creation
Eg: Pizza with type and place

AbstractFactory : an interface for creating family of products
Eg: Pizza ingredients factory

Singleton : Only on instance
Eg: Chocalate factory

Command : encapsulates request as an object ==> separate request from receiver and invoker
Eg: log requests, queue, undo

Adapter : converts a class as client expect(two different people: broker in middle)
Eg: Turkey as duck, enumeration -> iterator

Facade: unified interface for subsystem : principle of least knowledge
Eg: Home theater

Template : encapsulating algorithms (subclass decides one or more part of the algorithm resides in super class) : hollywood principle - don't call us, we will call you
Eg: Coffee or tea making, general sorting with comparable, Swing paint method, Applet

Iterator : access aggregated object without exposing underlying implementation : single responsibility - a class should have only one reason to change
Eg: Merging menus with list, array and hashtable

Composite : let clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly (tree like structure)
Eg: Submenu in menu

State : allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes : there is a static inbuilt algorithm for changes.
Eg: Gumball machine with state changes

Proxy: placeholder for another object to control access to it
Eg: RMI - gumball machines in network are monitored by a client(client side : stub, server side : skeleton)

MVC: 
-view is observer for model
-controller is the strategy for the view
-strategy means an algorithm
-can have multiple controller for a view
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10064105/mvc-why-controller-is-the-strategy-for-the-view
-view is a composite itself

Pattern categories:
1. Creational - Singleton, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory, Factory method
2. Structural - Decorator, Proxy, Facade, Composite, Flyweight, Bridge, Adapter
3. Behavioral - Mediator, Visitor, Template method, Iterator, Command, Memento, Interpreter, Observer, Chain of Responsibility, State, Strategy

Bridge: allows to change either side of hierarchies independently. (Need to change not only implementation, but also abstraction)
Eg: TV and remote, Separate window abstraction from window implementation for different OS (Button <<- skin(interface) <- WindowsSkin and MacSkin
(Abstraction layer changes don't affect implementation layer and vice versa)
Two layers of abstraction between classes and one class is dependent upon the other.

Builder: to encapsulate the construction of a product and allow it to be constructed in steps.

Chain of responsibility : chain of objects to examine a request. Passes to successor if it can't handle the request itself.
