Strategy : I don't like to have empty overriding methods just because I am going to introduce a new feature for some existing things
Eg: Flying feature for Duck

Observer : Observe on changes for one to many relationship
Eg: Overview, publisher-subscriber
Event Listeners in java

Decorator : kind of wrappers, add features dynamically
Eg: Coffee, Milk, Soy
Streams in Java

Factory : encapsulate object creation
Eg: Pizza with type

Factory method : allowing sub classes to decide object creation
Eg: Pizza with type and place

AbstractFactory : an interface for creating family of products
Eg: Pizza ingredients factory

Singleton : Only on instance
Eg: Chocalate factory

Command : encapsulates request as an object ==> separate request from receiver and invoker
Eg: log requests, queue, undo

Adapter : converts a class as client expect(two different people: broker in middle)
