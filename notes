Strategy : I don't like to have empty overriding methods just because I am going to introduce a new feature for some existing things
Eg: Flying feature for Duck

Observer : Observe on changes for one to many relationship
Eg: Overview, publisher-subscriber

Decorator : kind of wrappers, add features dynamically
Eg: Coffee, Milk, Soy
